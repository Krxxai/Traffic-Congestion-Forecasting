Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of peak hour traffic patterns across four major junctions in Pune, using 48,120 hourly traffic observations collected between November 2015 and June 2017. The objective of the study was to identify peak congestion periods using statistically valid methods and to understand the key factors influencing traffic intensity during those periods, with a focus on operational insights for Uber.

To avoid relying solely on visual inspection, peak hours were identified using four independent statistical approaches: percentile analysis, standard deviation thresholds, z-score testing, and moving average trends. The use of multiple methods ensured robustness and reduced subjective bias. All four methods showed strong agreement on peak periods, particularly during the evening hours.

The analysis confirmed two distinct daily peak periods. The morning peak occurs between 8–9 AM, while the evening peak spans from 5–8 PM and is both more intense and longer lasting. Traffic volumes during evening peak hours are approximately 50–60% higher than the daily average, making this the most critical congestion window. Statistical testing further confirmed that the difference between peak and non-peak traffic is highly significant.

Weather impact analysis revealed that rainfall plays a meaningful role during peak hours. Rainy peak periods experience a 15–18% increase in traffic compared to non-rainy peaks. This increase is attributed not to higher demand, but to slower vehicle movement, causing congestion to build up more quickly. In contrast, temperature, humidity, and wind speed showed weak or negligible influence on traffic volumes.

Event-based analysis showed that holidays have the strongest overall impact on traffic. Peak hour traffic drops by approximately 40% on major holidays such as Diwali and Independence Day, as offices close and travel demand reduces. Weekend analysis produced an important and somewhat unexpected result: Saturday traffic remains close to weekday levels, dropping by less than 10%, reflecting Pune’s work culture and commercial activity. Sunday shows a clearer reduction, though still not as large as typically observed in other metropolitan cities.

Junction-level analysis highlighted significant differences in congestion intensity. Junction 1 consistently experiences the highest traffic volumes across all time periods and requires priority attention for traffic management and resource allocation. While all junctions exhibit synchronized peak timing, the magnitude of congestion varies substantially, indicating system-wide congestion driven by work schedules rather than isolated bottlenecks.

Overall, this analysis provides a strong statistical foundation for peak hour identification and traffic prediction. The findings can directly support better driver allocation, surge pricing strategies, and operational planning for Uber, particularly during high-impact scenarios such as evening peak hours, rainy conditions, and major holidays.
